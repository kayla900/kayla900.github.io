		Everyone loves to travel. Although I haven't been to too many places, I would like to share with you all where I have been.

				<h3>Eugene</h3>
				<p class="w3-container w3-justify">I went to Eugene to visit my best friend who had been living with her boyfriend. He had moved there a couple years before and she was staying with him for the summer. I went on my birthday and stayed for the week. A bike was her main form of transportation so I rented one, which was something new to me. I also took my first city bus since I had always lived in a small town without public transport. Near the University of Oregon, there's a river that we went swimming in. We would ride over the bridge and hang out by the rocks. This was my favorite place I visited in Eugene because of its serenity and beauty.</p>

				<h3>Lennoxville</h3>
				<p class="w3-container w3-justify">As previously mentioned, I lived in Quebec for my first year of university. I went to Bishop's University in a small town called Lennoxville which is part of Sherbrooke. The university itself is English and most of the residents of Lennox are both franco and anglophone, but everywhere else in entirely French. This was a struggle for a girl like me that only had taken Spanish has her foreign language. One thing I always do when I go back to visit is get an authentic serving of poutine. </p>

				<h3>Wakefield</h3>
				<p class="w3-container w3-justify">Since I was 10, I've been going to my best friend's lakehouse in Wakefield, NH. I know her whole family and have even watched the kids grow. When we go there, it's just a time to relax and be silly. One time, all the adults went out to dinner and left us kids home. We decided to play a prank. We flipped everything in the house upsidedown. Needless to say, they were a little confused but mostly annoyed. We spend the days mostly fishing, swimming, and going for rides on the jetski. Most nights you can find us hanging my the fire, roasting marshmallows.</p>
